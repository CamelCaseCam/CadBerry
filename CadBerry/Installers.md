# Building CadBerry installers
CadBerry currently offers an installer for windows and a deb package for linux. Below are instructions to build the installers. 

## Windows
1. Install the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/ide/walkthrough-deploying-your-program-cpp) extension.
2. Add CadBerry installer/CadBerry Installer.vdproj to the solution.
3. Build the CadBerry installer.

## Linux
WIP, there'll be a script to generate a package soon
