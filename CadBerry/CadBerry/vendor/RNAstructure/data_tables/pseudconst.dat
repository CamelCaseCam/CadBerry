This file contains constants for calculating pseudoknot penalty
for SHAPEknots program.

All lines are considered comments and the actual constants are read 
only following the arrows. The names (a, b, c2 etc) are ignored and 
only the order is important.

Constant 'a' is the single-stranded length. It is being  multiplied 
by unpaired nucleotide count. 
a is 	        --> 6.5

Constant 'b' is the nested helix length. It is being multiplied 
by number of internal branches.
b is 	        --> 15

Constants 'c#" is the internal pseudoknot length. It is being  multiplied 
by number of spanning helixes with length '#' nucleotides.
c2 is 	       	--> 23.9
c3 is 		--> 23.9
c4 is 		--> 34.0
c5 is 		--> 23.8
c6 is 		--> 34.6
c7 is 		--> 57.6
c8 is 		--> 82.1
c9 is 		--> 65.3
c10 is		--> 527.5
c11 is		--> 2446.9
c12 is		--> 4198.8
c13 is		--> 6564.3
c14 is		--> 12540

Constant 'c15' is multiplied by number of spanning helix longer then 14 nucleotides  
c15 is 		--> 30000
