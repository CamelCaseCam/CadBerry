RNAstructure requires Microsoft Visual Studio.NET for compilation.

Both Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 produce a
bug in the partition function calculation (pfunction.cpp).

Alternatively, Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 will work when the Intel
C++ compiler is used.  This, however, results in an executable that
is about 20% slower than the Microsoft compiler.
