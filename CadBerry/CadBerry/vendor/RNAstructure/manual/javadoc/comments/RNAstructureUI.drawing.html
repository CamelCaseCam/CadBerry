<html><body>
A package that encapsulates all the Java classes that handle structure and dot plot drawing.
<br/><br/>
There are no classes in this package.
Instead, all Java drawing framework classes are in the subpackages of this one.
This is because the drawing framework is backed by C++ classes, and these C++ classes are separated from the Java classes in the RNAstructure_java_drawing folder.
C++ classes cannot be documented with Javadocs, but are documented with Doxygen formatting.
<br/><br/>
The drawing classes can either be integrated into existing Java software or compiled to create self-contained drawing executables.
Either a structure drawing program (which can draw one structure file at a time) or a dot plot drawing program can be made.
The runners package is necessary for these self-contained programs, but not necessary when classes are integrated into existing software.
