							<h2 class="leftHeader">General Build Information</h2>

							<h3 class="leftHeader">Do I need to build the package?</h3>
							<p>RNAstructure
is provided both as source code and as prebuilt executables. Prebuilt
executables are currently available for 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux, Max
OS-X (Leopard and higher), 32-bit Windows, and 64-bit Windows. If you
are using one of these operating systems, then you probably do not need
to build the package. The available executables will work fine.</p><h3>DATAPATH Variable</h3>
						<p>In order to successfully use the
data tables in the RNAstructure repository during calculations, an
environment variable called DATAPATH must be set to the location of the
data tables folder on the current machine.</p>
						<p>
							For example, in BASH, this is accomplished with:<br><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; $ export DATAPATH=&lt;<span style="font-style: italic;">PATH-TO-RNAstructure</span>&gt;/data_tables/</span>

							<a name="GUI"></a>
							<h2 class="leftHeader">Building the&nbsp;RNAstructure JAVA GUI</h2><br>The
RNAstructure Graphical User Interface (GUI)&nbsp;is composed of two
important components: &nbsp;the graphical front-end, written in Java
and the&nbsp;native back-end, <span style="font-weight: bold;">RNAstructure_GUI </span>libary&nbsp;written in C++. The two are linked using the Java Native Interface (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/">JNI</a>). In addition, <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> is used to generate C++ and Java "glue code" to provide necessary bindings on each side.<br><br>Due to this architecture, there are three phases to building the GUI, of which only two are usually required:<br><ol><li>(<span style="font-style: italic;">Optional</span>) Generating the SWIG code</li><li>Compiling the C++ libarary</li><li>Compiling the Java source code into class files and/or a Java JAR file.</li></ol><br>The first step involves running <span style="font-weight: bold;">swig</span>, which reads <span style="font-weight: bold;">*.i</span> files and parses C++ header files to generate <span style="font-weight: bold;">*.cxx</span> files that are later included in the compilation of the native <span style="font-weight: bold;">RNAstructure_GUI </span>libary. However, the RNAstructure distrubution <span style="font-weight: bold;">already includes the pre-generated&nbsp;SWIG
files</span>, so it is NOT necessary to run&nbsp;SWIG or even to have it installed&nbsp;unless you plan to
make changes to the public interface of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RNAstructure_GUI</span> library (i.e. to the header files inside the <span class="pathName">java_interface\SWIG</span> directory: <span class="pathName">RNAstructureBackendCalculator.h</span>, <span class="pathName">DotPlotBackend.h</span>, or <span class="pathName">StructureBackend.h</span>)<br><br>
Compilation of&nbsp;the C++ libary and the Java interface BOTH require installation of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle Java SE JDK</a>.
(The latest version is recommended for security reasons, but the
minimum version is <strong>1.8</strong>). &nbsp;The Java JDK is required (instead of
just the JRE) because it includes <strong>javac</strong>, the Java compiler, as well as
several C++ JNI header files that are necessary for compiling the
native library. &nbsp;Usually the location of javac as well as the JNI
header files can be determined automatically (during&nbsp;the "Make"
commands, below) however it might be necessary to modify some variables
inside the file "compile-java.h", especially on Linux systems, where
the installation location of Java can vary widely from one Linux
distributionand/or package manager to another. <br><br>All steps involved in building the GUI are performed using a Makefile in the <span class="pathName">RNAstructure/java_interface</span>
directory. &nbsp;Importantly, this Makefile is distinct from the
Makefile in the root RNAstructure directory, however it does include
several of the same files (e.g. compiler.h). These java-specific
commands can be run in a terminal/shell from within the&nbsp;<span class="pathName">RNAstructure/java_interface</span> directory:<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make gui</span> -&nbsp;Bulilds the native C++ libary as well as the&nbsp;Java JAR file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is usually the only operation most users will need to perform.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make swig </span>- Generates the SWIG "glue code" (<span style="font-style: italic;">only necessary if changing the public interface of the native library</span>)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make tester </span>- Builds the Java GUI Regression test program &nbsp;(<span style="font-style: italic;">only necessary for perfoming automated regression tests on the GUI</span>)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make all</span> - Performs all of the above build operations.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">make help</span> - Show a list of all valid Makefile goals.</li></ul><p>When the JAVA GUI is built correctly, two new files will
exist in the <span class="pathName">RNAstructure/exe</span> directory: a single large dynamic
RNAstructure library (whose name depends on the operating system), and
a JAVA JAR archive, called <span class="pathName">RNAstructure.jar</span>. See <a href="Running_Java_GUI.html">Running the RNAstructure JAVA GUI</a> for details on how to use these files.</p><hr>

							<h2 class="leftHeader">Building the Command Line (Text) Interfaces</h2>

							<h3 class="leftHeader">Configuring the Build on Unix/Linux/OS-X</h3>
							<p>The
command line (text) interfaces for RNAstructure are built using the
Makefile in the main directory (<span class="pathName">RNAstructure/</span>). The definitions for
compiler and flags are in RNAstructure/compiler.h. This file is
provided with the defaults set for compiling on Linux using g++. To
change the platform and/or compilers, this file should be manually
edited. Example flags are provided for Linux, Mac, and Cygwin
platforms. To change the operating system to a non-Linux system, simply
remove the "#" symbol (which denotes comments) from the variable
definitions under the target type. Also, add "#" in front of the Linux
flags.</p>
							<p>Note also that flags for building with OpenMP can
be set (CXXOPENMPFLAGS). The default flags will work for Linux and Mac
using g++ and g++/LLVM, respectively. An example flag set is also
provided for Intel compilers, and this will need to used if Intel
compilers are being used.</p>

							<h3 class="leftHeader">Building on Unix/Linux/OS-X</h3>
						  <p>To
build the package, use the command "make all" in RNAstructure/. The
command line executables are built and placed in RNAstructure/exe/. You
should probably then update your PATH variable to include this
directory.</p>
							<h3><a name="CUDA"></a><span class="leftHeader">Building CUDA on Unix/Linux/OS-X</span></h3>
							<p>In
adition, if you have a CUDA compiler, you can build partition-cuda by
typing "make cuda" in the RNAstructure directory. This can then be run
if you have a CUDA-capable graphics card.</p>
		          <p>An
optional "make install" command will copy all the executables to the
/usr/local/RNAstructure/ directory. This is helpful in a shared
computing environment. This command can only be executed as root.</p>
							<h3><span class="leftHeader"><a name="SMP"></a>Building Serial and SMP on Unix/Linux/OS-X</span></h3>
							<p>Dynalign,
Fold, Multilign, and TurboFold can be built in SMP form, which allows
them to delegate their workload across multiple processors at once in a
shared memory environment.</p>
                            <p>By
default, "make all" will build the serial programs and their SMP
counteparts. To build only the serial programs, for example if the
compiler does not have OpenMP support, "make serial" can be used with
the Makefile in the main directory (RNAstructure/). To build only the
SMP programs, use the "make SMP" target.</p>
                          <h3>Building <a href="../Text/Multifind.html">Multifind</a></h3>
                            <p>Multifind is built separately from the rest of the package.  It depends on an installation of libsvm, which handles the support vector machine calculation. To build it,<a href="Building_Requirements.html"> set the INCLUDESVM variable</a> to point to the libsvm installation and uncomment the line &quot;#MF = Multifind~&quot; by removing the &quot;#&quot;. Multifind will then be included with the list of standard RNAstructure programs and can be built with the command make Multifind or make Multifind-smp (for the parallel version). </p>
<h3 class="leftHeader">Building on&nbsp;Windows</h3><div style="margin-left: 40px;">There are two
options for compiling&nbsp;RNAstructure on Windows:&nbsp;
