object, which is used for running TurboFold. This library is not
self-contained, and must be linked together with the RNA library into
an executable. Unlike the TurboFold library (above), the TurboFold SMP

						<hr>

						<a name="RNAstructure"></a>
						<h3>The RNAstructure (JAVA) GUI Library</h3>
						<p>The
RNAstructure (JAVA) GUI library, unlike the other libraries on this
page, is a dynamic library, so it must always stay in the
RNAstructure/exe directory, and is not capable of being used for
anything other than its connection to the RNAstructure GUI. It holds
all information necessary to run calculations from the RNAstructure
GUI, so it contains some elements of all the other libraries on this
page. This library is self-contained and depends on no other libraries
once built. The names of this library, depending on the operating
system on which it is built, are as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux: <span class="pathName">libRNAstructure_GUI_32.so</span> (on 32-bit systems) or<span class="pathName">&nbsp;libRNAstructure_GUI_64.so</span> &nbsp;(on 64-bit systems)</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: &nbsp;<span class="pathName">libRNAstructure_GUI.dylib</span></li>
							<li>Windows: &nbsp;<span class="pathName">RNAstructure_GUI_32.dll</span> (on 32-bit systems) or &nbsp;<span class="pathName">RNAstructure_GUI_64.dll</span> &nbsp;(on 64-bit systems)</li>
