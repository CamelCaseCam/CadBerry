							<p><b>How to <a name="CreateEdit" id="CreateEdit">Create and Edit</a> an RNA or DNA Sequence</b></p>
							<p>For
a new sequence, select "File -&gt; New Sequence" from the menu. This
brings up an empty sequence editor window. Type a title into the title
box, if desired. Then, click the comment box with your mouse. Here, you
may type a comment of any number of lines, if you wish. Finally, move
to the sequence box and type in your sequence 5' to 3'.&nbsp;You may use T's, U's, or both. The RNA folding algorithm assumes the
sequence is RNA and will interpret a T as a U. The DNA folding module
will likewise assume DNA and interpret U as T.</p>
							<p>You
may also use X to represent a gap or unknown base. Before exiting,
select "File -&gt; Save Sequence" or "File -&gt; Save Sequence As..."
to save the sequence. Sequences can be&nbsp;saved in&nbsp;SEQ or FASTA
formats.</p>
							<p><a name="Warning" id="Warning">WARNING</a>: Bases entered in <b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">lower case</span> are not allowed to base pair</b> in any generated structure, so make sure to enter all bases in UPPER-CASE unless you intentionally want to mark them as unpaired. &nbsp;For example, in the sequence<span style="font-family: monospace;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCGGA</span></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">uuca</span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">GAUAG</span>, the blue lower-case bases will not be allowed to base pair.

							<p><b><a name="Load" id="Load">Loading Sequences</a></b></p>
							<p>To
load a sequence, select "File -&gt; Open Sequence." Three types of
files can be loaded: sequence (SEQ) files, Genbank files, and simple
text files. Sequence files follow a specific sequence format (See "<a href="Appendix_of_File_Formats.html">Appendix A: File Formats</a>"), Genbank files follow the Genbank format, and simple text files contain a sequence of bases with nothing else.</p>

							<p><b>Editor Features</b></p>
							<p>For ease of entering a sequence, the RNAstructure editor can give <a name="Audio" id="Audio">audio</a>
feedback as a sequence is entered. If your computer has sound
capabilities, there are two different ways by which a structure can be
read out loud. If the "<a name="ReadTyping" id="ReadTyping">Speak While Typing</a>" checkbox under the "Speak" menu is selected, bases will be read out loud as they are typed into the editor. and the "Speak While Typing" checkbox is selected, you will hear the sequence being read as it is typed into the editor. If the "Speak Sequence" menu item is clicked, the sequence will be read aloud from the beginning in its entirety. The "Stop&nbsp;Speaking" button will stop this automatic reading at any time. When the "Speak Sequence" button is pressed again, reading restarts at the beginning of the sequence.</p>
							<p>The editor can <a name="Format" id="Format">format</a> a sequence into a Genbank-like format. Pressing the "Format" button will arrange the sequence into&nbsp;segments 10 bases long, separated by spaces, with a maximum of five&nbsp;segments (50 bases) per line.</p>
							<p>The "Fold RNA" and "Fold DNA" buttons will input the sequence directly into the "<a href="Fold.html">Fold</a>"
module, with the appropriate nucleic acid type selected. RNAstructure
will request that the sequence be saved as a sequence file first, if
the sequence has not been saved.</p>
