							<h3>General Information</h3>
							<p>The
core of RNAstructure is a dynamic programming algorithm to predict RNA
or DNA secondary structures from sequence based on the principle of
minimizing free energy. The <a href="http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/">thermodynamic parameters</a>
used for RNA predictions are the latest available from the Turner
laboratory. Several modules are provided to extend the capabilities of
secondary structure prediction, including the prediction of a secondary
structure common to two sequences, and to make this a user-friendly RNA
folding program.</p>
							<p>RNAstructure was originally written by
David H. Mathews for Isis Pharmaceuticals and is made available for the
RNA community by Isis. RNAstructure is now supported by U.S. National
Institutes of Health grant #R01GM076485. It is available on <a href="http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu">the Mathews Lab Homepage</a>.</p>
							<p>Two other modern implementations of the dynamic programming algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction are <a href="http://bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/%7Ezukerm">mfold/UNAfold</a>, available on the World Wide Web at Michael Zuker's homepage, and the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/%7Eivo/RNA">Vienna RNA package</a>,
maintained by Ivo Hofacker. The implementation of the thermodynamic
parameters differs in multibranch and exterior loops, therefore some
differences in the predicted lowest free energy structures are expected
by different packages.</p>
							<p>Research benefitting from this program should cite the journal references on which this program is based (See "<a href="References.html">References</a>").</p>

							<h3><a name="Requirements" id="Requirements">Requirements</a></h3>
							<p>RNAstructure can be run on Windows, Macintosh, or Linux systems.</p>
							<p>On&nbsp;Linux and Windows the program requires Java version 1.7 or higher. Oracle Java can be downloaded at: <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">http://java.com/en/download/</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>The
application bundle for Mac OS X includes the Java runtime, so it is not
necessary to have Java installed on the system, but OS X <span style="font-weight: bold;">10.8.3 (Mountain Lion)</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">or above</span> is required.</p>
