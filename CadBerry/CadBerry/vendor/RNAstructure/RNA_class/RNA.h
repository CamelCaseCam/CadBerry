		//Constructors:
		//******************************
		

		//!Constructor - user provides a sequence as a c string.

		//!	Input sequence should contain A,C,G,T,U,a,c,g,t,u,x,X.
		//!	The sequence is case-sensitive. Lower case letters are marked as unpaired.
		//!	T=t=u=U.  If IsRNA is true, the backbone is RNA, so U is assumed.  If IsRNA is false, the backbone is DNA, so T is assumed.
		//!	x=X= nucleotide that neither stacks nor pairs.
		//!	Unknown nucs result in an error.
		//! Note that sequences will subsequently be indexed starting at 1 (like a biologist), so that the 0th position in the sequence array will be nucleotide 1.
		//!	\param sequence is a NULL terminated c string.
		//!	\param IsRNA is a bool that indicates whether this sequence is RNA or DNA.  true=RNA.  false=DNA.  Default is true.
		RNA(const char sequence[], const bool IsRNA=true); 

		//!Constructor - user provides a filename for existing file as a c string.
		//!	The existing file, specified by filename, can either be a ct file, a sequence, or an RNAstructure save file. 
		//!	This constructor generates internal error codes that can be accessed by GetErrorCode() after the constructor is called.  0 = no error.
		//! The errorcode can be resolved to a c string using GetErrorMessage.		
		//!	Note that the contructor needs to be explicitly told, via IsRNA, what the backbone is because files do not store this information.
		//! Note also that save files explicitly store the thermodynamic parameters, therefore changing the backbone type as compared to the original calculation will not change structure predictions.
		//! \param filepathOrSequence is null terminated c string that can be either a path to a CT, SEQ, FASTA, PFS, SAV, or DBN file or a full RNA sequence (whitepsace allowed)
		//! \param fileType is an RNAInputType (e.g FILE_CT, FILE_SEQ etc) that indicates what type of file filepathOrSequence refers to. 
		//!             If filepathOrSequence is an in-place sequence, fileType should be SEQUENCE_STRING.
		//!	\param alphabetName is a c-string that specifies the alphabet name (e.g. "rna",  "dna", etc)
		//!	\param allowUnknownBases boolean that determines the handling of unknown bases (i.e. those not defined in the alphabet)
		//!	       If allowUnknownBases is true, they will be interpreted as bases that neither pair nor stack. 
		//!	       Otherwise they will result in an error.
		//!	\param skipThermoTables If true, only the alphabet specification will be loaded, not the full thermodynamic energy tables.
		//!             The default is false -- i.e. load all tables. This should only be set to true in programs that never make use of energies -- i.e. ct2dot etc.

		//!	This constructor generates internal error codes that can be accessed by GetErrorCode() after the constructor is called.  0 = no error.
		//! The errorcode can be resolved to a c string using GetErrorMessage.

		//! Note also that save files explicitly store the thermodynamic parameters, therefore changing the backbone type as compaared to the original calculation will not change structure predictions.
		//! \param filename is null terminated c string.
		//! \param fileType is an integer that indicates the file type.
		//!	\param IsRNA is a bool that indicates whether this sequence is RNA or DNA.  true=RNA.  false=DNA.  Default is true.
