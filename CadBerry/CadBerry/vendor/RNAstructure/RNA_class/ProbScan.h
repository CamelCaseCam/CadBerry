    //!	For now, any unknown nuc is considered 'X'.
    //! Note that sequences will subsequently be indexed starting at 1 (like a biologist), so that the 0th position in the sequence array will be nucleotide 1.

    //!		type = 1 => .ct file, type = 2 => .seq file, type = 3 => partition function save (.pfs) file, type = 4 => folding save file (.sav).
    //! If the input file is ont a partition function save file, the partition function will be calculated. If the sequence is long, this may take some time.
