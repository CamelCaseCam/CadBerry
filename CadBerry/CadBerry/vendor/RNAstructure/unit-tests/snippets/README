This directory contains small code snippets used to test new features or changes to 
RNAstructure, or to clarify or verify existing c/c++ library or compiler behavior.

These code fragments are stored here because they could potentially be useful in future
testing, debugging, or feature addition -- or as reminders/documentation of previous tests
or attempts to implement various features or changes.

This directory is not required for building or testing RNAstucture, and is not likely to be useful
for anyone other than core developers, so it should not be distributed with public releases.
Moreover any of these files can be deleted once deemed no longer relevant or helpful.
