<h1>CadBerry Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#cadberry-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>CadBerry packages let you distribute your modules and modifications in a single file that handles installation and updating. This page will teach
you how the package system works, but first I need to tell you the #1 rule of CadBerry packages. Unless you’re working on the core editor, never
ever <strong>ever</strong> mess with the CadBerry.cdbpkg file. This is the core editor’s package file, and unless you’re <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> careful, you could brick
your CadBerry installation.</p>
<section id="how-to-write-a-package">
<h2>How to write a package<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-write-a-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CadBerry packages are written in YAML and parsed using the yaml-cpp library. First, create a new cdbpkg file in the same directory as your
CadBerry executable.</p>
<p>Next, open the file and fill in the following fields:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Name: Package name
Version: Package version (optional)
Downloaded: The date the package was last downloaded. You can set this to anything
Source:
  Owner: GitHub repo owner username
  Repo: GitHub repo name
  Branch: GitHub repo branch
  Path: path within the GitHub repo to the files. If the files are in the main folder of the repository, you can set this to nothing
Files: [File 1, File 2, ...] (paths relative to Path)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Something important to note about these files is that they only support github repositories. When the user opens the editor, CadBerry checks if
the last commit to the source repo is different from the date the package was downloaded. If it is, it opens a window prompting the user to
update the package.</p>
<p>If you set Downloaded to something like “Download this package”, CadBerry will think the package needs to be updated and will prompt the user to
update it. This way, you can distribute a single cdbpkg file that works as both a downloader and an updater for your module.</p>

<h2>Help! I messed with CadBerry.cdbpkg<a class="headerlink" href="#help-i-messed-with-cadberry-cdbpkg" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you messed with CadBerry.cdbpkg and haven’t updated the “CadBerry core” package yet, you’re in luck! Your changes haven’t been applied, so you
can just download the unchanged package file from the GitHub and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>If you did click update, you’re in a bit more trouble. You have two options. First, you could re-download CadBerry from the GitHub and continue on
with whatever you were doing before. If you choose this option, make sure to download a completely new version instead of downloading the
individual components.</p>
<p>Your other option is to try to fix your current installation. First, you’ll need to get the updated package from the GitHub and download the
working Berry.exe and CadBerry.dll files. Once you’ve got these, delete all other dlls being used by CadBerry and run the editor. You should get a
minimal version that can only update packages. Once you get the package window, click update to recover the rest of the CadBerry packages.</p>
