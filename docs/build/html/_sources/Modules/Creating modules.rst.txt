Creating CadBerry modules
=========================
CadBerry allows you to create modules to quickly add functionality to the editor. 

How to create a module
----------------------
1. Clone the entire CadBerry repository (this way it has all the libraries that CadBerry depends on)
2. Open the premake file and copy the VSCodeIntegration project
3. Change the name of the duplicated project to the name of your module
4. Scroll down to postbuildcommands and change "/VSCodeIntegration/VSCodeIntegration.pdb" to "/YourModuleName/YourModuleName.pdb"
5. Use premake to regenerate the project files

At this point, your module has been created. Now we need to create the module and window classes. 

1. Create a file that will contain your module. I usually call it "Module.cpp". This is like your main file. 
2. Include "CadBerry.h"
3. Create a TestWindow class that inherits from CDB::Viewport. Inside the constructor, call the CDB::Viewport constructor with the name of the window as a parameter
4. Create a TestModule class that inherits from CDB::Module. Inside the constructor, call the CDB::Module constructor with the name of your module as a parameter
5. Override the GetModuleNames function. This function sets the NumViewports variable to the number of viewports and returns the raw pointer to an array of std::strings. Each of these strings is the name of a window that your module adds. In this example, you'd set NumViewports to 1 and the array you return should contain "TestModule". 
6. Override the CreateViewport function, this function returns a raw pointer to a viewport that it creates based on the viewport name paramater. Since we only have one viewport, you can just return a new TestWindow. 

Now that the module and window is created, we need to expose the module to CadBerry. 

1. Wrap everything after this in extern "C"
2. Define the function `__declspec(dllexport) CDB::Module* __stdcall GetModule()`
3. Within this function, return a new TestModule

If everything worked, you should be able to compile this and have it automatically add the module to CadBerry's modules folder. If you run 
Berry.exe, you should see an option with the name of your module in the windows menu option.
