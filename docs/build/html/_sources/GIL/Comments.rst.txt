Comments in GIL
===============
GIL supports both single-line and multiline comments. GIL comments are exactly the same as C# comments. 

Single-line comment\:

.. code-block:: none

   //Your comment goes here

Multiline comment:

.. code-block:: none

   /*
   One line of comments
   Another line of comments
   */
