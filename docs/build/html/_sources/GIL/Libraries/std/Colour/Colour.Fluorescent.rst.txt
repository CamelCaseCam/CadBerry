This file contains a bunch of fluorescent colour proteins (Not finished, should be coming in the next update)

Includes:
---------
(Green)

* EGFP
* sfGFP (SuperGFP)
* wtGFP
 
(Blue)

* EBFP
* EBFP2
* Azurite
* mKalama1
* BFPms1

(Cyan)

* ECFP
* Cerulean
* CyPet
* mTurquoise2

(Yellow)

* YFP (P_YFP)
* Citrine
* Venus

* RedFP
* BlueFP
* CyanFP
* YellowFP
