Importing other GIL files
=========================
You can import other GIL files using the import keyword. These files are put into their own namespace with the name used to import it to prevent 
clashes with your code. 

You can import a file by name if it's in the same directory as your current project or (by the 0.1 release) if it's in your 
compiler's Libraries folder.

Example:

.. code-block:: none
   
   import "TestFile"    //Will be loaded into the TestFile namespace
