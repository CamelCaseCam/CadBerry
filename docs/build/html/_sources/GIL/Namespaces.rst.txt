GIL Namespaces
##############
GIL supports namespaces as a way to organize your code. This feature is extremely buggy, so expect lots of changes in the future. 

You can specify a namespace using ``namespace Name``. Everything inside this namespace will be put into a child GIL project. One problem with the 
current approach is that things within the namespace can't directly access the namespace. 

Because GIL sequences and operations aren't compiled until they're first called, they're actually compiled in the main namespace of your program. 

Accessing namespaces
====================
GIL allows you to access namespaces in a similar way to C++. In GIL, you put ``NamespaceName: Something`` or ``NamespaceName:Something``. In the 
future, I'll update this to make it exactly like C++.
