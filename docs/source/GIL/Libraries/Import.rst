Importing other GIL files
=========================
You can import other GIL files using the import keyword. This will let you access any sequences and 
operations in that file. This is still **incredibly** glitchy, so proceed at your own risk. 

You can import a file by name if it's in the same directory as your current project or if it's in your 
compiler's Libraries folder. Otherwise, you can import a GIL file by its exact or relative path
